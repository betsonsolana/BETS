### How the AI Works

#### 1. **Market Analysis**
The $BETS AI continuously scans and monitors cryptocurrency markets in real time. It collects and processes vast amounts of data from multiple sources, including:
- Market order books and trade volumes.
- Historical price movements and patterns.
- Macroeconomic events impacting cryptocurrencies.
- Social sentiment analysis (e.g., trends from forums, social media, and news outlets).

#### 2. **Prediction Models**
Using machine learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Reinforcement Learning (RL), the AI predicts short-term price movements for BTC, ETH, USDT, and SOL. These models identify:
- Price trends and reversals.
- Arbitrage opportunities between perpetual trading markets.
- High-probability entry and exit points for trades.

#### 3. **Perpetual Trading Strategy**
Perpetual contracts allow traders to hold positions indefinitely without expiration dates. The $BETS AI employs the following strategies:
- **Hedging:** Balancing long and short positions to minimize risks during market volatility.
- **Leverage Optimization:** Dynamically adjusting leverage based on market conditions to maximize gains while mitigating risk.
- **Funding Rate Arbitrage:** Capitalizing on funding rate discrepancies between perpetual contracts on different exchanges.
- **Scalping:** Conducting high-frequency trades to profit from small price fluctuations.

#### 4. **Integration with Jupiter Aggregator (jupiter.ag)**
The $BETS AI utilizes Jupiter Aggregator (jupiter.ag) to execute trades seamlessly on the Solana blockchain. Jupiter.ag offers:
- **Optimal Routing:** Identifies the best trading routes across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana to minimize slippage and fees.
- **Liquidity Access:** Aggregates liquidity from a variety of sources to ensure efficient trade execution.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Provides instantaneous data for dynamic trade adjustments, enabling the AI to act swiftly in volatile markets.

The integration with Jupiter Aggregator enhances the AIâ€™s ability to perform high-frequency and arbitrage trading while maintaining cost efficiency and speed.

#### 5. **Risk Management**
To protect against adverse market conditions, the AI incorporates:
- **Stop-loss mechanisms:** Automatically exiting losing trades at pre-set thresholds.
- **Portfolio diversification:** Allocating funds proportionally among BTC, ETH, USDT, and SOL.
- **Volatility Analysis:** Avoiding trades during periods of extreme unpredictability.

### Profit Distribution

#### 1. **Profit Calculation**
The AI calculates net profits daily by factoring in:
- Gains from successful trades.
- Costs associated with funding rates and exchange fees.
- Losses from unsuccessful trades.

#### 2. **Airdrop Mechanism**
All net profits generated by the AI are distributed to $BETS token holders through an automated airdrop mechanism:
- **Snapshot Timing:** A blockchain-based snapshot of token holder balances is taken at the end of each trading day.
- **Proportional Distribution:** Profits are allocated based on the percentage of total $BETS tokens held by each wallet.
- **Automatic Execution:** Airdrops are executed through smart contracts to ensure transparency and eliminate manual intervention.

#### 3. **Holder Benefits**
- **Passive Income:** Holders earn a share of trading profits without active participation.
- **Trust and Transparency:** The distribution process is verifiable on the blockchain.
- **Continuous Rewards:** As the AI operates perpetually, token holders receive regular income.

### Key Features
- **24/7 Trading:** The AI operates around the clock, taking advantage of opportunities in global markets.
- **Decentralized Airdrops:** Profit distributions occur automatically through blockchain technology.
- **Multi-Asset Support:** Focused on four of the most traded and trusted cryptocurrencies.
